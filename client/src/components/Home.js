          It is the Worlds First Dual-Head Paddle Sport!  The game can be played on both pickleball and racquetball courts.
          A no rally zone separates two players armed with a double ended paddle.  The game is played without a net.
          The two ended paddle, combined with the
          lack of net, make for an unexpected change in game mechanics from games like tennis or pickleball.
          It is a whole new ball game!  Bring both hands, you will need them!
